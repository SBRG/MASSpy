masspy - Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation in Python
========================================================

What is masspy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **M**ass **Action** **S**toichiometric **S**imulation for **Py**thon
(masspy) is a modeling software package for the construction and
analysis of kinetic models of biochemical reaction systems.

One of the main goals of masspy is to integrate seamlessly with  **cobrapy**,
a widely used constraint-based reconstruction and analysis python package in
order to provide a wide range of modeling techniques that can be utilized
seperately or together. For further information about cobrapy, please visit
<https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy>`_.

Cite
----
A manuscript is in preparation for publication and will be the proper reference
for citing the masspy in the future.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended method to install masspy is to use pip to `install masspy from
PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/masspy>`_ (we recommend doing this
inside a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_)::

		pip install masspy

If you downloaded the source code, run::

		pip install -e .

in the ``masspy`` directory. For additional information, please refer to the
the `detailed installation instructions <INSTALL.rst>`_.
