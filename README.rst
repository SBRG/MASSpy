MASSpy - Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation in Python
========================================================

|PyPI|

What is MASSpy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **M**\ass **A**\ction **S**\toichiometric **S**\imulation **py**\thon
(**MASSpy**) package contains modules for the construction, simulation, and
analysis of kinetic models of biochemical reaction systems.

**MASSpy** is built to integrate seemlessly with **COBRApy**, a widely used
modeling software package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of
biochemical reaction systems. Therefore **MASSpy**  can be used seperately from
or in conjuction with **COBRApy**, thereby providing a wide range of modeling
workflows and techniques.

Additional information about **COBRApy** can be found in its
`documentation <https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ or
`github page <https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy>`_.

Cite
----
A manuscript is in preparation for publication and will be the proper reference
for citing the **MASSpy** in the future.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended method is to install **MASSpy** is to use ``pip`` to
`install masspy from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/masspy>`_. It is
recommended to do this inside a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_)::

	pip install masspy

You can install all packages, including optional dependencies, directly by::

    pip install masspy[all]

If you downloaded the source code, run::

	pip install -e .

in the ``masspy`` source directory. For additional information, please refer to the
the `detailed installation instructions <INSTALL.rst>`_.
