## Optimization in MASSpy

By default, **MASSpy** comes with the `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`__ solver. However, specific features of
**MASSpy** require a commercial optimization solver with additional solving capabilities. For more information, check out the
section on `solvers <https://masspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/quickstart.html>`_.
