Installation of MASSpy
=======================

All releases require Python 3.6+ to be installed before proceeding.
Users without python can download and install python from the `python website
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
Please note that though Anaconda and other python distributions may work
with **MASSpy**, they are not explicitly supported.

Stable version installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MASSpy** can be installed with any recent installation of pip.

You can install all packages, including optional dependencies, directly by::

    pip install masspy[all]

Instructions for several operating systems are below:

Mac OS X or Linux
-----------------

1. `install pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_.
2. In a terminal, run ``sudo pip install masspy``

We highly recommend updating ``pip`` beforehand
(``pip install pip --upgrade``).

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

The preferred installation method on Windows is also to use pip. The
latest Windows installers for Python 3.4 and up include pip, so if you
use those you will already have pip.

1. In a terminal, run ``C:\Python36\Scripts\pip.exe install masspy``
(you may need to adjust the path accordingly).

To install without pip, you will need to download and use the
appropriate installer for your version of python from the `python
package index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/masspy/>`_.

future update.
