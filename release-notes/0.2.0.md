## New features

* Installation and setup updates based on the following PEP guidelines:

    - [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)
    - [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/)

    - Added `black.yml` for linting to `.github/workflows`.

* Added `.editorconfig` file for consistent dev configuration.

## Fixes

* Apply `src/` layout to package.
* Details for installation and setup updates:

    - New file `pyproject.toml` for building package based on `setup.cfg`,
      [setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html),
      and [pypa/build](https://github.com/pypa/build).
    - New file `.bumpversion.cfg` to seperate `bumpversion` functions from `setup.cfg`.

        * Updates to release order in bumpversion based on PEP 440 release candidates.
          Excludes *preN.postM*, *preN.devM*, and *postN.devM* releases.

    - Updates to sphinx documentation builder to account for new build.

* Changes to `.github/workflows` files

    - Renamed the following files:

        * `black.yml` --> `lint.yml`
        * `python-publish.yml` --> `publish-pkg-pypi.yml`

    - Updated `publish-pkg-pypi.yml` to use new build.
    - Updated `python-publish.yml` and `publish-docker-images.yml` to activate only on final release tags, and allow test publishing for master branch in `python-publish.yml`.
