Constraint-based models are widely used to compute steady state properties of such reconstructions, but the attainment of dynamic models has remained elusive. We thus developed the MASSpy software package, a framework that enables the construction, simulation, and visualization of dynamic metabolic models. MASSpy is based on the mass action kinetics for each elementary step in an enzymatic reaction mechanism. MASSpy seamlessly unites existing software packages within its framework to provide the user with various modeling tools in one package. MASSpy integrates community standards to facilitate the exchange of models, giving modelers the freedom to use the software for different aspects of their own modeling workflows. Furthermore, MASSpy contains methods for generating and simulating ensembles of models, and for explicitly accounting for biological uncertainty. MASSpy has already demonstrated success in a classroom setting. We anticipate that the suite of modeling tools incorporated into MASSpy will enhance the ability of the modeling community to construct and interrogate complex dynamic models of metabolism.},

	abstract = {The completion of the human genome project and the construction of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps have lead to significant efforts to find SNPs that can be linked to pathophysiology. In silico models of complete biochemical reaction networks relate a cell's individual reactions to the function of the entire network. Sequence variations can in turn be related to kinetic properties of individual enzymes, thus allowing an in silico model-driven assessment of the effects of defined SNPs on overall cellular functions. This process is applied to defined SNPs in two key enzymes of human red blood cell metabolism: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. The results demonstrate the utility of in silico models in providing insight into differences between red cell function in patients with chronic and nonchronic anemia. In silico models of complex cellular processes are thus likely to aid in defining and understanding key SNPs in human pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Author Summary We are now in the age of big data. More than ever before, biological discoveries require powerful and flexible tools for managing large datasets, including both visual and statistical tools. Pathway-based visualization is particularly powerful since it enables one to analyze complex datasets within the context of actual biological processes and to elucidate how each change in a cell effects related processes. To facilitate such approaches, we present Escher, a web application that can be used to rapidly build pathway maps. On Escher maps, diverse datasets related to genes, reactions, and metabolites can be quickly contextualized within metabolism and, increasingly, beyond metabolism. Escher is available now for free use (under the MIT license) at https://escher.github.io.},

Applications include nonredundant constraint identification, global optimization, and Monte Carlo integration. These algorithms are reversible random walks that commonly incorporate uniformly distributed step directions. We investigate nonuniform direction choice and show that, under regularity conditions on the region S and target distribution G, there exists a unique direction choice distribution, characterized by necessary and sufficient conditions depending on S and G, which optimizes the Doob bound on rate of convergence. We include computational results demonstrating greatly accelerated convergence for this optimizing direction choice as well as for more easily implemented adaptive heuristic rules. },

	abstract = {As one of the most recent members of the omics family, large-scale quantitative metabolomics data are currently complementing our systems biology data pool and offer the chance to integrate the metabolite level into the functional analysis of cellular networks. Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.},

@article{MHM14,
	abstract = {Constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. Therefore the solutions to this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. By uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction's flux in the network can be obtained. However, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. Furthermore, the constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. Therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optGpSampler), which implements the Artificial Centering Hit-and-Run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the COBRA Toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpSampler. Results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optGpSampler is up to 40 times faster than gpSampler. Application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network reconstructions indicate that optGpSampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpSampler towards similar sampling distributions. For networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optGpSampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms.

	abstract = {This is the first in a series of three papers {$[$}see also Mulquiney and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 579-594; Mulquiney and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 595-602{$]$} that present a detailed mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism which explains the regulation and control of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) metabolism. 2,3-BPG is a modulator of haemoglobin oxygen affinity and hence plays an important role in blood oxygen transport and delivery. This paper presents an in vivo kinetic characterization of 2,3-BPG synthase/phosphatase (BPGS/P), the enzyme that catalyses both the synthesis and degradation of 2,3-BPG. Much previous work had indicated that the behaviour of this enzyme in vitro is markedly different from that in vivo. 13C and 31P NMR were used to monitor the time courses of selected metabolites when erythrocytes were incubated with or without {$[$}U-13C{$]$}glucose. Simulations of the experimental time courses were then made. By iteratively changing the parameters of the BPGS/P part of the model until a good match between the NMR-derived data and simulations were achieved, it was possible to characterize BPGS/P kineticallyin vivo. This work revealed that: (1) the pH-dependence of the synthase activity results largely from a strong co-operative inhibition of the synthase activity by protons; (2) 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate are much weaker inhibitors of 2,3-BPG phosphatase in vivo than in vitro; (3) the Km of BPGS/P for 2,3-BPG is significantly higher than that measured in vitro; (4) the maximal activity of the phosphatase in vivo is approximately twice that in vitro, when Pi is the sole activator (second substrate); and (5) 2-phosphoglycollate appears to play no role in the activation of the phosphatase in vivo. Using the newly determined kinetic parameters, the percentage of glycolytic carbon flux that passes through the 2,3-BPG shunt in the normal in vivo steady state was estimated to be 19{\%}.},

@article{SQF+11,
	abstract = {Over the past decade, a growing community of researchers has emerged around the use of constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods to simulate, analyze and predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes using genome-scale models. The COBRA Toolbox, a MATLAB package for implementing COBRA methods, was presented earlier. Here we present a substantial update of this in silico toolbox. Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) 13C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language--formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods.},

@article{YAHP18,
	abstract = {Author summary Enzymatic rate laws have historically been used to simulate the dynamics of complex metabolic networks with regulated reactions represented by allosteric rate laws. Here, we use detailed elementary reaction descriptions of regulatory enzymes that allow for the explicit computation of the fraction of the enzymes that are in a catalytically-active state. The fraction of the enzyme that is in the active state represents the time-dependent utilization of the enzyme's ``catalytic potential,'' its capacity to catalyze a reaction. We apply this interpretation to red blood cell glycolysis, examining how three key kinases with allosteric regulation modulate their utilization of their catalytic potential based on ligand-binding events throughout the network in order to maintain a homeostatic state. We then examine how an enzyme modulates its utilization of its catalytic potential using personalized data as a case study, visualizing the systems-level properties of a kinetic model.},
