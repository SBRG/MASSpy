From the basis of cobrapy, COBRA uses constraint based analysis to determine fluxes within and out of a particular system; for such model construction, an immense ammount of information is not required to derive constraints on a system based on it's fluxes. However, masspy requires much more adept analysis as an influx of information is created to determine the mass action stoichiometric solutions of any given model. Whereas COBRA focuses more on the mathematical aspect, MASS constructs models and determines the analytical portion of the model."
