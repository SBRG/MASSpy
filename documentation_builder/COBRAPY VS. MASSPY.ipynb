From the basis of cobrapy, COBRA uses constraint based analysis to determine fluxes within and out of a particular system; for such model construction, an immense ammount of information is not required to derive constraints on a system based on it's fluxes. However, masspy requires much more adept analysis as an influx of information is created to determine the mass action stoichiometric solutions of any given model.
