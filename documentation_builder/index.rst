Introduction to Masspy Documentation
================================================


Introduction and Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation for Python (masspy) is a modeling software package for the construction and analysis of kinetic models of biochemical reaction systems.

One of the main goals of masspy is to integrate seamlessly with cobrapy, a widely used constraint-based reconstruction and analysis python package in order to provide a wide range of modeling techniques that can be utilized seperately or together. For further information about cobrapy, please visit their github page.
